AIM Travel & Tours — Data Analytics Project (2024)
✨ End-to-End Portfolio Project using SQL, Python & Tableau
📌 Project Overview

This project simulates real operations of AIM Travel & Tours Ltd, a UK-based chauffeur/tour operator.
The goal was to analyse profitability, operational costs, customer trends, and route performance using:

MySQL (database creation, ETL, analysis queries)

Python (data cleaning, EDA, visualisation)

Tableau (interactive dashboards)

Excel/CSV (data management)

Although the dataset is synthetic, it is fully modeled on real business logic, pricing, costs, routes, trip types, passenger figures, and seasonality.

🎯 Business Questions Answered

Which routes and trip types generate the most profit?

Which vehicle type performs better financially (Car vs Minibus)?

Which customer segments (Tourists, Families, Corporate) are most profitable?

How do profits fluctuate by month and season?

Which cost drivers (fuel, maintenance, tolls, driver stays) impact total costs the most?
