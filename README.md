# Aim_Travel_Data_Analytics_Project
End-to-end data analytics project using synthetic but realistic travel-industry data. Includes MySQL database, Python analysis, Tableau dashboards, and business insights.
AIM Travel & Tours — Data Analytics Project (2024)
✨ End-to-End Portfolio Project using SQL, Python & Tableau
📌 Project Overview

This project simulates real operations of AIM Travel & Tours Ltd, a UK-based chauffeur/tour operator.
The goal was to analyse profitability, operational costs, customer trends, and route performance using:

MySQL (database creation, ETL, analysis queries)

Python (data cleaning, EDA, visualisation)

Tableau (interactive dashboards)

Excel/CSV (data management)

Although the dataset is synthetic, it is fully modeled on real business logic, pricing, costs, routes, trip types, passenger figures, and seasonality.
